<h2>Project Description</h2>    
<p>
    This project involved developing a professional technical instruction
    document designed to guide beginners in preparing a café-quality
    matcha latte at home. The instructions emphasize clarity, organization,
    safety, and precision while explaining traditional Japanese whisking
    techniques used to produce smooth microfoam and balanced flavor.
</p>

<p>
    The document includes a disclaimer, introduction, required tools,
    step-by-step procedures, cautions, and cleaning instructions to ensure
    that readers with no prior experience can successfully follow the
    process and achieve consistent results.
